# Unit 1.1 - Introduction

<a href="/slides/1_1-introduction/" target="_blank">Slides</a>

This is the open-source Rust training material we use for our professional multi-day (embedded) Rust training programs.

It comprises several modules based on the material of the [teach-rs](https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/education/) project (now part of [Trifecta Tech Foundation](https://trifectatech.org)) that we previously co-developed and that we contribute back to when improvements are made.

## Let us train you!

Studying on your own is good, but being guided with your team through an interactive tailor-made program is... well, better! (And a lot more fun as well!)
